# Digital Forensics Lab Automation - Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Automation Engine (Weeks 1-2)
### Priority: CRITICAL
- [ ] **Deploy Jenkins** with forensic-specific configuration
- [ ] **Create Jenkins Pipelines** for each evidence type
- [ ] **Implement IRIS API integration** for automated case management
- [ ] **Build evidence intake system** with web interface

### Deliverables:
- Jenkins master/slave architecture
- 4 core processing pipelines (disk, memory, mobile, malware)
- Basic web portal for evidence submission
- IRIS case auto-creation

## Phase 2: Data Processing & Correlation (Weeks 3-4)
### Priority: HIGH
- [ ] **Deploy additional forensic tools** (CAPE, Guymager, Yara)
- [ ] **Create Logstash parsers** for all tool outputs
- [ ] **Build Kibana dashboards** for forensic analysis
- [ ] **Implement real-time IOC correlation** with MISP

### Deliverables:
- Complete forensic tool suite
- Real-time data ingestion from all tools
- Forensic-specific Kibana dashboards
- Automated IOC matching and alerting

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Reporting (Weeks 5-6)
### Priority: MEDIUM
- [ ] **Automated report generation** with templates
- [ ] **Cross-case correlation** analytics
- [ ] **Timeline generation** and visualization
- [ ] **ElastAlert rules** for anomaly detection

### Deliverables:
- Automated forensic reports
- Timeline analysis capabilities
- Advanced correlation analytics
- Comprehensive alerting system

## Phase 4: User Experience & Scalability (Weeks 7-8)
### Priority: MEDIUM-LOW
- [ ] **Advanced web interface** for analysts
- [ ] **Mobile evidence collection** app
- [ ] **Multi-tenant architecture** for organizations
- [ ] **Performance optimization** and scaling

### Deliverables:
- Full-featured analyst workbench
- Mobile field collection tools
- Enterprise-ready architecture
- Performance benchmarks

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Jenkins Deployment
```yaml
# Create playbooks/jenkins-forensics.yml
- Deploy Jenkins with forensic plugins
- Configure multi-user authentication
- Set up pipeline libraries
- Create forensic-specific Jenkins jobs
```

### 2. Evidence Intake System
```python
# Create web interface for evidence submission
- Flask/Django web application
- Evidence upload and validation
- Automatic Jenkins job triggering
- IRIS case creation API calls
```

### 3. Core Pipeline Templates
```groovy
// Jenkinsfile templates for each evidence type
- Disk image analysis pipeline
- Memory dump processing pipeline
- Mobile device extraction pipeline
- Malware analysis pipeline
```

### 4. Logstash Forensic Parsers
```ruby
# Logstash configuration files
- Autopsy output parser
- Volatility3 JSON parser
- Andriller report parser
- CAPE sandbox parser
```
